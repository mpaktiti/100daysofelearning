# 100 Projects of eLearning

I recently moved to eLearning, working as an Instructional Designer, and I have a lot to learn.

What better way than by practice?

This repository contains a number of projects. These projects are not full courses, but individual bits and pieces (or as we call them, interactions). I'm learning how to use each one by building a simplistic project, so I can later use them in full blown courses. 

Each project has its own folder. Each folder contains the [Articulate](https://360.articulate.com) source file (extension .story), and the full HTML5 export.
